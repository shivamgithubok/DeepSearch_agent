# Who is Narendra Modi?

Narendra Modi is a prominent Indian politician who currently serves as the 14th and current Prime Minister of India.  While the provided research findings are absent, publicly available information paints a clear picture of his life and career.

## Early Life and Political Beginnings

Modi was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, Gujarat, India.  He was the third of six children born to a family of grocers.  He helped his father sell tea as a child.  Modi has often described his childhood as one marked by poverty.  He joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organization, at a young age.  He later became a full-time worker for the RSS.

## Rise in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)

Modi's organizational skills and dedication within the RSS led to his involvement in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He rose through the party ranks, holding various positions before becoming the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001.

## Chief Ministership of Gujarat (2001-2014)

Modi served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat for over 12 years. His tenure was marked by a focus on economic development and Hindu nationalist policies.  This period also saw the 2002 Gujarat riots, a highly controversial event that remains a subject of debate and scrutiny.

## Prime Ministership of India (2014-Present)

In 2014, Modi led the BJP to a landslide victory in the general elections, becoming the Prime Minister of India.  He was re-elected in 2019 with an even larger majority.  His prime ministership has been characterized by a focus on economic reforms, social welfare programs, and a strong emphasis on Hindu nationalism.  Key policy initiatives include demonetization, the Goods and Services Tax (GST), and the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.

## Public Image and Ideology

Modi cultivates a strongman image and is known for his charismatic oratory skills and extensive use of social media.  He is a proponent of Hindutva, an ideology that seeks to define Indian culture through Hindu values.  His policies and rhetoric have been praised by supporters for promoting development and national pride, while critics have raised concerns about the erosion of secularism and the rise of intolerance.
